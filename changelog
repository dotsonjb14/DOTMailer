1.0.0 
Initial Release

1.0.1
Fixes:
fixed alt text not being used when no attachment is sent.
fixed DOTMailer::From was not being referenced, it was referencing DOTMailer::header which does not exist.

1.0.2
Changes:
Added an option to not include alt text with html. Yahoo does not parse multipart messages very well so I made this option.
You can use it by setting DOTMailer::NoAlt to true. The current example uses that option.

1.1.0 dev1
Changes:
I started to move implementations to a separate folder, accessed by a factory method.
This will be a slight change (one line) and old code will work with the new version
