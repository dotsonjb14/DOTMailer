this is my (joseph dotson's) php emailing class

I wrote this because doing attachments in PHP is way harder than it needs to be.

If you see any issues, please let me know. You can message me here, and I will respond in time.

If you find a bug please enter it into the issues section. I will find it and if it's possible I will fix it. 

I will not be adding any vendor specific MIME. So if that's what you need please do not bother me with it.

I only added the NoAlt fix because it is a valid option, and I needed it for work (yes, this IS used in production code...)

I started adding PEAR functionality, however I probably won't be finishing this soon. As I do not have a working SMTP server to test this. If someone wants to finish this, I would be happy to accept.

NOTE: you can safely use the new dev version as long as you don't use PEARMailer. DOTMailer should work fine with the new enhancements. If you NEED PEARMailer, than you might just want to wait, or implement something yourself (most of the utility work is already done).
