this is my (joseph dotson's) php emailing class

I wrote this because doing attachments in PHP is way harder than it needs to be.

If you see any issues, please let me know. You can message me here, and I will respond in time.

If you find a bug please enter it into the issues section. I will find it and if it's possible I will fix it. 

I will not be adding any vendor specific MIME. So if that's what you need please do not bother me with it.

I only added the NoAlt fix because it is a valid option, and I needed it for work (yes, this IS used in production code...)

I have not tested sending in PEARMailer. I have checked the body, and it looked all fine. If someone wants to test it for me that would be awesome.
